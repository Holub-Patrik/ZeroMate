# 02 - factorial non-recursive

## Description 

This example is quite similar to example [01 - factorial_recursive](../01-factorial_recursive/README.md). It calculates `25!`, which purposely does not fit into a 32-bit register. The result of the operation is therefore 3,519,021,056, which once CPU halts, can be viewed in register R0.

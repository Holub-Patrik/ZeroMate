# 05 - fibonacci non-recursive

## Description

The purpose of this example is to calculate the `100th fibonacci number` in an iterative way. The 100th fibonacci number is 218,922,995,834,555,169,026. However, this value cannot be stored as a 32-bit integer and the result found in register R0 should therefore be 3,314,859,971.

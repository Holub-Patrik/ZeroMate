# 06 - LED toggle

## Description

This example is the first example that interacts with GPIO pins. In particular, it periodically turns on and off the built-in LED, which, on the Raspberry Pi Zero board, is internally connected to GPIO pin 47. Once the kernel is executed, the pin activity can be viewed in the GPIO window of the emulator.

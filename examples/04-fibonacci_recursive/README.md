# 04 - fibonacci recursive

## Description

This example calculates the `10th fibonacci number` in a recursive fashion. While, this approach may not be the most effective to get the answer, it tests out a proper use of the stack through its recursive calls. When the CPU halts, the contents of register R0 (the return value) should be 55.
